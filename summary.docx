Few important analysis and actionable insights steps are-


1) Eradicated duplicate data based on review_description column.

2) There's a significant correlation between the cost of wine and its rating.

3) Top three wines according to price are from France.

4) After removing all countries with less than 100 observations, it appears that Germany, Austria, and Canada have the highest median scores(points).

5) I'll be dropping any wine types with less than 200 observations, for the reason that I don't believe there's enough data in these buckets to generate an accuarte model for predicting their respective wine type.
